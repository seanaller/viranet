# Viranet
ViraNet. The host-virus modelling tool.

## Description
This is the Phyton implementation of the host-virus modelling presented in the pre-print "Aller et al, 2017" (reference below).

There are two main folders:
* MATLAB implementations of host-virus models
* The actual NCBI files for the viruses, that were used in "Aller et. al. 2017".
